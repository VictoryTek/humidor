# Release Notes - Version 1.1.0

**Release Date**: December 5, 2025

## 🎨 New Features

### Light/Dark Mode Theme Toggle
- **Theme Switcher**: Added a theme toggle button in the top-right header (next to user account menu)
- **Two Beautiful Themes**:
  - **Dark Mode** (default): Premium cigar lounge aesthetic with rich mahogany, warm browns, and gold accents
  - **Light Mode**: Soft warm parchment background with the same premium gold accents
- **Persistent Preference**: Your theme choice is saved to browser localStorage and remembered across sessions
- **Smart Consistency**: Key UI elements maintain dark theme styling in both modes for visual consistency:
  - Navigation panel selection colors
  - Quantity counters on cigar cards
  - Stats cards (Total Cigars, Cigar Types)
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions provide a polished theme switching experience

## 🎯 UI/UX Improvements

### Theme Design Philosophy
- **Light Mode Color Palette**: Carefully crafted warm, cigar-appropriate colors
  - Soft parchment backgrounds instead of harsh white
  - Rich charcoal-brown text for excellent readability
  - Same vibrant gold/copper accents as dark mode
  - Warm clay-gray borders
- **Consistent Gold Accents**: Both themes use the same premium gold (#d4af37) and copper (#b87333) colors
- **Optimal Contrast**: All button text uses deep chocolate brown (#1a0f08) for maximum readability on gold backgrounds
- **Accessibility**: Maintained high contrast ratios in both themes for better readability

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Implementation
- CSS Variables for theme management
- `.light-mode` class toggle on root element

- Material Design Icons for theme toggle (moon/sun icons)

## 📦 No Breaking Changes

This release is fully backward compatible with v1.0.0. All existing functionality remains unchanged.

## 🙏 Notes
