[advisories]
# Treat unmaintained advisories as warnings rather than errors
unmaintained = "warn"

# Ignore specific advisories that are acceptable
ignore = [
    # fxhash unmaintained - transitive dependency via selectors crate
    # Dependency chain: humidor -> scraper 0.24 -> selectors 0.31 -> fxhash 0.2.1
    # Rationale for ignoring:
    # - Not a security vulnerability, only unmaintained status
    # - Transitive dependency we don't control directly
    # - selectors crate is actively maintained by Mozilla Servo project
    # - Latest scraper version (0.24) still uses selectors 0.31
    # - Unmaintained ≠ vulnerable - no known security issues
